# CNC Tool Management 

    - It is a project that I want to implement in my work daily basis as a CNC Machinist/Programmer united with my will of using and studying code.


## Objective

    - Improve the management of tools for machinery shops by having data about tool changes.

### Ideas to be applied
    
 
        -Screen to input values to be read:

            - Tools:
                - ID (input).
                - Quantity in stock (input).
                - Cutter, Drill, Tap or Saw (select).
                - Tool Nature: *L* for *long* or *S* for *short* - (select)
            - Machines:
                - ID (input).

        - *Screen to select values and declare the tool changing*

            - ID (Select existing one).
            - Quantity Changed (input).
            - Type of tool (Select existing one).
            - Tool Nature (Select existing one).
